Hi Mustafa,

Thank you for the video. My feedback is broken down by dashboard:

Admin Dash Board. 
Would like to see a How Many Documents button alongside the "Revoked" button. 
This should show the total number of documents that have been uploaded..

Doctor Dash Board. 
On the doctors dashboard they should have a set of blank forms, ie. Perscriptions, 
Bllod test, xray report etc. For now we could just go with these three. 
I'm thinking I should send you the fields like when they fill out a contact form. 
The the "Reports" would be all of the forms theyve filled out.

Patient Dashboard: 
they would see a list of uploaded reports (forms that have been filled out by the patient or doctor) and as you have, 
they would be able to share with a doc or another member. 
They should also have the ability to upload 
(really create an additional report via a form just like the doctors have) 
if for example they have an old blood report or old perscriptions they would like to add to 
their account they could manually enter them in.

I will send you the fields for each form/report tonight.
